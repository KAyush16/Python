Palndrome Example:
    -->  Application in Genetics. Works in DNA sequencing generates a vast quantities of data, 
        but standard compression algoritmns don't compress DNA sequences well- theu often end up larger after compression.

        In the last 20 years, algorithms have been developed to provide more efficient compression of the data using palindromes
         in DNA sequences.

    -->  A palindromes is a word that reads the same backwards as forwards
