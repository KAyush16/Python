'''
Infinite Recursion: Using self.lives(insted of self._lives) inside _set_lives calls the setter method again, leading to infinite recursion.
Correct Access: Use the underlying attribute (self._lives) inside getter and setter methods to prevent this issue.

What Happens with lives = property(_get_lives(), _set_lives())
When you write: lives = property(_get_lives(), _set_lives())

You are actually calling _get_lives() and _set_lives() immediately and passing their return values to property. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown of why this is incorrect:

Calling Methods Immediately:

_get_lives() is called immediately when the property line is executed, which will raise an AttributeError because _get_lives is trying to access self._lives, but self is not defined in this context.

_set_lives() is also called immediately, but without the necessary lives argument, which will raise a TypeError.

Expected Callables:
property expects the names of methods (which are callable objects), not the results of calling those methods.
